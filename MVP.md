###MVP and future timeline:

Monday:
Morning: Will finish dummies/preliminary regressions by mid-day. (12:00)
Preliminary Graphs are up on "Bokeh EDA, Dummies.ipynb". Once Preliminary
models are up, this will indeed be a Minimum "Viable" Product. (But probably
not that viable)

Since the focus will be a dashboard for visualization, all graphs will be done
in Bokeh for output code in html when complete.

Afternoon:
Will explore model optimizations/tuning. Make final decisions to see if
regression of estimated earnings or classification of wins is a better metric.

Tuesday:
Morning: More model optimizations.

Afternoon: Set up flask option/bootstrap for visualization. Set up EC2/S3 for
mining rest of site (for potential visualization of entire database)

Wednesday:
Morning: Optimizations and tuning, as well as Tuesday Afternoon work.

Afternoon: Design dashboard elements

Thurs/Friday: Any coding elements to satisfy above.

Overall:

Dashboard will contain graphs of the name of the game, number of players
that have cashed in through tournaments, win statistics and demographic
information. Will also have predictions if applicable.

Ideally visualizations will be dynamic in nature, and as real-time as possible.

Future addons (time permitting):
Filtering
Output file through Filtering
